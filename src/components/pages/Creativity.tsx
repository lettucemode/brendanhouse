              Brendan House is a house of spiritual renewal for makers &amp; artists

            devoted to joyful, utter abandonment to Jesus Christ through prayerful use of the graces of making and the
            arts. Rooted first in worship, we seek to pass on what weâ€™ve been given by becoming deployable creative
            resources for the kingdom of God in the areas of healing and discipleship. We grow into this capacity in
            ourselves and others through corporate prayer, training, affectionate community, and{' '}

          <p>
            Creativity and creative work are themes of every initiative of Brendan House, and the leadership team
            members are encouraged to maintain their own artistic practice as an aspect of their pastoral ministry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our initial goal is to implement a sustainable rhythm of praying the hours that is supported by and
            hospitable to concurrent creative practice, understanding making as an expression of worship itself, not an
            adjunct to it.
